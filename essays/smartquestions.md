## Understanding the Purpose of a Question

Questions are a tool for learning. This tool, like other tools, can be used in a way to make it more efficient. Questions influence a transfer of information between two people, and in order to make this exchange as efficient as possible it is important to communicate our ideas and uncertainties as clearly as possible. Informed questions that are backed by thought, research, and effort help to sharpen this tool so that it targets the heart of the problem. A lazy question, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. 

## The Benefits of Informed Questions

When a question is considered to be informed, it goes beyond just requesting information. An informed question should be formed in a way that shows others that the asker has put their own effort into understanding and trying to fix the problem. That important aspect of a question will signal to others that you value the answers that you recieve. 

Given that effort is put into the problem beforehand, an informed question should be specific. The question should outline exactly what the problem is, what has been attempted, and where the confusion is still at. Specificity helps to make questions easier to answer and also prevents the parties from wasting time clarifying details.

Here is an example of an informed question:

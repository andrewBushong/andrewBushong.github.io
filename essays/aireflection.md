## The Importance of AI

Artificial Intelligence has become a dominant tool in the new age of technology. It has transformed the way we approach problems and how we develop solutions across many different industries. Software engineering and AI have a particularly strong connection, as AI is able to assist developers in writing code, finding errors, and helping developers to learn concepts more efficiently. I learned through my use of AI in a software engineering class that AI is a powerful learning tool when used responsibly and can greatly improve efficiency when used correctly.

## Personal Experience with AI:

### Background
In my software engineering class, WODs stand for "workout of the day" and were one of the core elements of my software engineering class. WODs are usually timed assignments which would involve coding and showing that you learned the material for the assignment. However, there also Experience WODs which are done at home and can be timed or untimed. They usually revolved around learning a new software tool such as Github or implementing my knowledge of the readings from that week.The course allowed the free use of AI as long as the use is documented.

### 1. Experience WODs
For experience WODs I would try to stay away from AI. Experience WODs were learning heavy. It involved mostly reading and following documentation and I would not get much out of AI for these WODs. Our professor would also link a video to the solution for that WOD if it involved any coding and I found it much more useful to watch the video after my attempt and to learn from that. The only times I would turn to AI is if the documentation was unclear and I needed to ask questions that the documentation didn't cover.

### 2. In-class Practice WODs
Practice WODs were on Tuesdays and usually had the purpose to prepare us for the real WOD on Thursday. These WODs would be similar to the real WODs so they were very useful as a learning experience. Because I viewed it as a learning experience I also tried to stay away from AI. This approach worked for the first half of the class until concepts became more difficult and I would come across more bugs. I used AI in the practice WODs to primarily debug things like syntax issues and with this approach I mostly would finish over the timer for the WOD but would learn more.

### 3. In-class WODs
I followed a similar approach with AI in practice wods as I did with the real WODs. I started by not using AI for the first WODs but would start to fall behind on the timer. This is where I started utilizing AI for efficiency. I would use it to generate code snippets which helped to speed up simple tasks like styling or creating an HTML structure. This allowed me to have more time to focus on the harder parts of the assignment and helped me to stress less about the timer.

### 4. Essays
Technical essays were required in this class and were about concepts relating to software engineering. The only time I would use AI for these assignments were to brainstorm what I wanted to write about. 

### 5. Final Project
My final project for this class was a group project which involved developing a web application. I used AI heavily in the final project. I found that it was great for sanity checking your work and performing simple tasks. This is also where I learned the importance of prompting. When building a bigger application and utilizing AI, the AI will not know the context and can produce a lot of faulty code if you are unclear. I noticed that I would get the best use of AI for prompts like "I am trying to implement a new schema in my data base, I did ...., am I missing any important steps?" or "Style this post page like how this page is styled". Overall, my final project helped me to the limits of AI and what it is capable of doing at a proficient level.

### 6. Learning a Concept/Tutorial
Learning concepts/tutorials with AI helped me if I was running into issues trying to follow a tutorial. I at most times, found the documentation to be sufficient in teaching me the concept. However, there were some times where I needed to ask questions for clarity and AI helped me there.

### 7. Answering a question in class or discord
I never used AI for answering questions in class or discord.

### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question
I would use AI if I needed better wording for a question but I would never answer a smart question with AI.

### 9. Coding Example
I would use AI to give me coding examples. It usually came when learning a new topic and I wanted to see the different applications of that topic. For example, if I was learning react I would ask for a simple webpage using react components and an explanation of how they are used.

### 10. Explaining/Writing/Documenting Code
Explaining, writing, and documenting code were very helpful things that I found AI to be able to do. AI was good at breaking down code to a very miniscule level if needed. I would use AI a lot to explain code that I needed to use as a template. It was also good at explaining the code that it would write. Writing code is a different story though. I learned that AI does not do a very good job at writing complex code and was best used when performing small to medium tasks with very specific prompting. For documenting code, I did not use AI because I did not have trouble documenting it myself, but I think it would've been a useful thing to use there based off of how well I have seen it document its own code.

### 11. Quality Assurance
I would find AI very useful when assuring the quality of my code. It would help a lot when I came across an ESLint error that I have not seen before and it would explain the error and solution well. I found that more complex issues were impossible to solve solely with AI and I would go around in circles with the AI if the issue was too complex.

### 12. Other Uses
A use of AI that I found to be helpful was for planning. If I had a Practice WOD that contained multiple steps I would ask AI what the best steps for completing the WOD would be. Another aspect of planning that it helped me do was breaking down a bigger task down into smaller ones. This was useful in the final project when I wanted perform a big task like creating a page that reads/writes from a database. It helped to break things into smaller steps and made it easier to manage.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI is a double edged sword when it comes to learning. It is able to significantly enhance the experience when used right but can also leave you learning nothing when used wrong. Personally, AI has helped me most when used as a teacher. Using it to answer questions and fill knowledge gaps was very useful when learning new topics. It would help my learning and understanding the most when I would treat it as a professional that I had questions for. On the otherhand, AI was a challenge to learning if I just wanted it to do heavy lifting. Things like writing code or fixing errors without explanation were both harmful if I didn't take the time to understand what it was outputting. Learning and understanding with AI is as effective as the user makes it. If you use AI with your mind set on learning, you will accomplish that. If you use AI just because you need it done and are too lazy to learn, you will also accomplish that. I learned that AI will help you accomplish what you want to do but it is up to you to be responsible enough to use it as a learning tool rather than a coding slave.

## Practical Applications
For uses outside of this class, I found AI to be most useful when brainstorming or needing suggestions. For example, one of my personal projects involves having sets of notecards that people can use to help them learn. One of the features that AI helped me to brainstorm was having mini games which would help encourage learning with the notecards. It also suggested that I change the layout of my database so that it is more friendly to features that I would want to implement in the future.

## Challenges and Opportunities
The main challenge of AI in this class was the incentives of using it. When it comes to timed WODs you are greatly benefitting from using AI in these assignments. However, this can create an unhealthy relationship between learning and efficiency. You may think that AI is helping you because your WOD time decreased but you may also be losing opportunities to fully understand the concepts and develop problem solving skills during the WOD. Due to this challenge, I think it would have been better if the use of AI was more limited and the timers were to adjust to that change. I also think a good opportunity for AI integration in this course would be to use it to review code. AI was most useful to me when I used it to suggest improvements to my already proficient code. It helped me to understand where I am able to improve and gave me a perspective when viewing my code. I think it would be good for future students to take advantage of this and improve their coding skills with essentially no room for AI to do work for them.

## Comparative Analysis
When comparing traditional teaching with AI enhanced approaches, I find traditional teaching to have a major upperhand due to having a real person with a real voice teaching you. That upperhand helps with knowledge retention because there is more engagement. Not to mention that instructors can respond and there is zero doubt behind their words. Due to this, I think learning is much more enjoyable and effective with traditional teaching but I still think AI enhanced approaches has its benefits. AI integrated classes help students get familiar with the concept of learning with AI which I believe will be very important in the future. AI integrated classes can help them to understand the limits of AI and how it can be ineffective to learning.

## Future Considerations
AI in software engineering education will be a prominant component. Learning with AI is going to be an essential skill that software engineers need to learn. I think that is where the focus should be more shifted towards. In depthly educating students about the dangers and benefits of AI would help the efficiency of AI integration and can be the make or break of actually learning the material in this course. The main disadvantage of AI in this course was the feel of being pushed to use it. I often thought that I would learn more from the WODs if I just was able to sit there and do them without being worried about a time limit rather than trying to meet the time limit with the use of AI. With that being said, I believe it would be useful to allow the use of AI for more complex assignments but not allow the use of AI for timed assignments. This would help students to feel less pressured to rely on AI while still allowing them to understand how AI can be helpful.

## Conclusion
My experience with AI in this class showed me the potential and limitiations that it has. Learning with AI is a whole other way of learning and requires self responsibility. When using it responsibly, you are able to reap the rewards of efficiency when it comes to learning and coding. However, irresponsibly using it can lead you to learning nothing. Whether you get the benefits or the drawbacks entirely depends on how you use it. With that, I think the focus of AI integration should be shifted more towards teaching students the right ways of using it and the bad ways of using it. This is the first class I have taken that allowed use of AI, and I don't think a class should have as much free will of AI as this class did, but there should still be opportunities to learn how to use it responsibly.

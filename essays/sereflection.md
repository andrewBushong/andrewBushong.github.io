As my last days come to an end in my software engineering course, I am able to look back on this class as a great learning opportunity. I learned how to build a web application and the fundamental lessons that came along with the process. This class emphasized two things which changed my perspective on software engineering: Agile project management and coding standards. I quickly realized while taking this course that there are challenges when it comes to a group project that can hurt a teams collaboration. By implementing the concepts of coding standards and agile project management, I was able to experience first hand how they shape a groups skills of organizing and communicating.

## Coding Standards
Coding Standards were one of the most important concepts when learning to work with others. It is important when collaborating with others to have a shared approach to doing things, and this is what coding standards aim to do. They provide a consistent medium for us to code in and makes it easier to read and maintain eachothers work. Our class required that we use ESLint, which is a form of applied coding standards that identied errors and inconsistencies within our code. When ESLint was first introduced to me, I found it quite annoying to see all of the errors. But as time went on, I warmed up to to the idea and when I was working with a group, I started to find the value behind these coding standards. It helped to keep things consistent and organized and reading my group members code became much easier. It became a valuable tool that helped my group to improve our collaboration and reduce confusion which ultimately saved us time. For this reason, I believe it is one of the most important aspects of group projects and can be the difference between a disorganized workflow and a well-coordinated team.

## Agile Project Management
Agile project management is another concept that I found a lot of value in. Agile project management emphasizes iterative development which means the project is broken down into smaller tasks. I really enjoyed this approach to developing programs because it helped to tackle things one part at a time and make everything seem much more manageable. At the beginning of our project there just seemed to be so much features and implementation that needed to be done and it felt overwhelming. However, when we broke things down into smaller steps and gave our assignments and expected completion times, things seemed much more manageable. Planning in this fashion helped so things were organized and done sequentially. Things like creating mockup pages and mockup components helped to make a read/write database implementation much more easier and appealing to do. Overall, this approach helped me to improve productivity and made the development process more enjoyable, both of which are needed for a software engineering environment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, my software engineering class helped me more than to just build a web application. I learned through hands on experience that there are collaborative planning aspects that can help a group to be more productive and on the same page. It taught me that software engineering is more than just writing code and there is a deeper level of planning that can effect the success of a project. Coding standards and agile project management helped demonstrate how organization and shared expectations can improve not just the efficiency but also the enjoyability of software engineering.

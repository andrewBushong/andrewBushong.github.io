## The start

My interest in computer science came from my interests when I was young. As a kid, my favorite subject in school was math. I loved math because it gave me puzzles to solve and the feeling of completing a math problem was extremely good compared to finishing an assignment in another class. However, as time went on I realized I didn’t really love math as much as I thought I did. Concepts got harder, formulas got longer, and I came to the conclusion that I was in love with the process of math, not math itself. It brought me joy to think logically, apply my knowledge to the problem, and see things slowly fall into place. That realization is what brought me to computer science. Computer science is the extension of what I loved about math. It gives me problems that I need to solve but in an open ended and creative way while also giving me the same “rush”.

## Goals

My long term goal for my future in this field is to simply make the world a better place. Whether it is creating an application that makes someone’s life a little more organized or creating something that changes how society functions. I want people to utilize tools that I create and wonder “Why hasn’t this been made sooner?” The potential is endless and can all be done from your fingertips and that is the beauty of this field. I truly believe that software engineering gives you the ability to change the way the world works, you just need to have the vision and commitment to do so. 

Of course this is easier said than done and I will need many more years of experience to accomplish my goal to a satisfiable extent but that brings me to my immediate goal of just wanting to be more experienced. I need to expose myself to more people, projects and concepts. Most of my experience academically is back end development and I really wish to learn more about the front side of things. I look forward to gaining more of an insight into the problems that full stack developers run into, along with the mindset that is needed in order to be successful.

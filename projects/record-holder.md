summary: "A program made in my ICS 211 class that holds records in a linked list and has features for modifying the list."
---




The record holder is a program made in C that holds records as objects and stores them in a linked list structure. The program allows users the ability to add new records, search for existing ones, show all existing, and delete records. The program also has a debug feature that helps when implementing new functions. The program maintains records in order and ensures that memory is managed correctly, preventing memory leaks.  

This project was done by myself in my ICS 211 class and I was able to gain experience with coding in C. I was able to apply my knowledge of C to utilize pointers to create a linked list structure. I was responsible for creating a user interface and implementing various functions that allowed for modification/reading of the record list. Some of the functions required the use and knowledge of pointers for the individual nodes in the list. I also needed to implement a debug mode which printed important information that was being passed, modified and returned by the individual functions.

I learned the importance of taking things step by step with memory management. I learned to be careful to avoid memory leaks or useless pointers. The debug mode helped me realize that it is useful to have a way of tracking the programs behavior when testing the program. The record holder project helped me to build confidence in building a data structure and facing the challenges that come with it. I also became more comfortable with C's standard input/output functions when developing the interface used for this project.

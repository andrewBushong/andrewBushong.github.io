UH Connect was created as the final project to my software engineering class. It was a group project which aimed to help gamers across campus to find others to play with. The web application allowed users to create a profile which displayed interests and allowed for people to connect through posts or through a search function. The application also allowed admins to be able to add local events and create new games on the site for users to post about.

I was able to contribute to this project on both the frontend and backend. I contributed to the design for the home page, games page, and create a post page. I was also responsible for implementing posts to the website which required me to create the prisma model for posts and ensure that the pages were properly reading and writing from the database. For this project we used React, Next.js, and PostgreSQL along with Github to manage the project.

This project was a great learning opportunity as I was able to gain insight and experience on the software development process. This experience taught me not only technical skills through design/function implementation but also on how to work more efficiently with others. Concepts like agile project management and coding standards showed how valuable they could be in a team setting.
